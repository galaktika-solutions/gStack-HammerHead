# `gStack`

A complete software stack built on Docker to develop and run modern small-to-medium size Django based web applications.

## Project Goals

Setting up and configuring the complete stack for a web application can be complex. By packaging all the dependencies into a Docker image and providing a thin abstraction layer with a carefully chosen set of defaults while leaving enough room for configuration, `gStack` lets you spin up a project within a few minutes.

Apart from the productivity goals we keep a close eye on some other aspects of app development and operations:
- Strong security by default
- Easy extendability
- Auditability for professional usage
- User and developer experience

## Quick Setup for Development

### Prerequisite
`linux`, `git`, `docker`, `docker-compose`

### Installation

- Clone the repo and `cd` into the resulting folder.
